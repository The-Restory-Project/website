Client Corrections:

- Picture on homepage, sides of the pages (floral, simple designs like on our posts on social media - minimal colour)

- Linking therapist bios to a send email option - if people click on highlighted words for example - a draft email can come up with our email id in the sending place already. Breaking our bios into smaller paragraphs instead of one large one - highlighting key words.

- Under the collaboration tab, please add the sentence “Corporates and other organizations can contact us to help in assisting a more healthy work environment (through workshops, webinars, support groups, workplace counselling).

- When clicking on “Email” us hyperlink, in the contact section, nothing comes up in the new tab.

- Clean up coming soon in Shop page

- Add payment gateway for products

- Create tutorials for CMS usage

- Add background images ref: instagram backgrounds

- Home page side Image
